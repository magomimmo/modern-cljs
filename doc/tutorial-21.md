# Tutorial 21 - Learn by Contributing (Part 2)

In the [previous tutorial][1] while starting to learn the [Enfocus][2]
lib we ended up by collaborating with [Creighton Kirkendall][3] in
deeply refactoring both the directories layout and the `project.clj`
configuration of his very interesting and promising lib with the
intention of preparing it to be unit tested by using the
[clojurescript.test][4] lib. 

## Introduction

The first instict would be now to go on in this tutorial by starting
to implement few unit tests for the `enfocus` lib based on the
[clojurescript.test][4] unit testing lib. But we are going to postpone
this topic to a next tutorial for a couple of reasons:

* first, because to be able to define any unit tests for the `Enfocus`
  lib, we should at least know its basic use cases which we still have
  to learn about;
* second, because we want to anticipate few `project.clj` settings
  which affect the packaging of the `Enfocus` lib in a `jar` artifact
  to be published.

In this tuturial we're then going on to improve the directories
layout and the `project.clj` file of the `Enfocus` lib by:

* preparing the lib to be correctly packaged in a `jar`;
* intrumenting the lib with [piggieback][5] lib;
* extending the application of the separations of concerns principle
  to the static resources of the project;
* publishing the modified `Enfocus` lib on [clojars][6];
* creating a very simple project which depends on the refactored
  `Enfocus` lib.

### Enfocus Packaging

In the [previous tutorial][1], while substituting the `cljx` plugin
with the `:crossovers` option of the `cljsbuild` plugin, we
substituted the `:hooks [cljx.hooks]` setting with the `:hooks
[leiningen.cljsbuild]` setting as well.

This way the `cljsbuild` tasks have been hooked to the main `lein`
tasks. That's why we were able to issue the `lein do clean, compile`
chain of commands instead of the more verbose `lein do clean,
cljsbuild clean, cljsbuild once` chain of commands.

Following is the list of the supported `lein` main tasks when
`cljsbuild` is hooked to it:

```bash
* lein clean # calls lein cljsbuild clean task
* lein compile #call lein cljsbuild once task
* lein test # call lein cljsbuild test task
* lein jar
```

The first three hooked `lein` tasks have already been used and you
know about them. Let's now try the `lein jar` task by first take a
look at the associated help:

```bash
lein help jar
Package up all the project's files into a jar file.

Create a $PROJECT-$VERSION.jar file containing project's source files as well
as .class files if applicable. If project.clj contains a :main key, the -main
function in that namespace will be used as the main-class for executable jar.

With an argument, the jar will be built with an alternate main.

Arguments: ([main] [])
```

Good. the `lein jar` tasks seems to be exactly what we need to package
the `Enfocus` lib in a `jar` to be deployed and published on
[clojars][6].

Let's use it.

```bash
lein do clean, compile, jar
Deleting files generated by lein-cljsbuild.

Compiling ClojureScript.
Created /Users/mimmo/devel/enfocus/target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Now take a look at content of the `enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` jar
package.

```bash
jar tvf target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    92 Fri Oct 11 15:57:26 CEST 2013 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

  4386 Fri Oct 11 10:26:10 CEST 2013 enfocus/macros.clj
```

Oh my God. The emitted jar contains all the `cljsbuild` JS files
generated by the `cljsbuild` builds and the CLJ source files too, but
it does not contain any CLJS source file.

Aside from the `META/INF` stuff and `project.clj` file, we would like
to package into the `Enfocus` jar only the source files and resources
needed by a third party developer to use the lib itself. More
precisely:

* the CLJ source files: `macros.clj` and `syntax.clj`
* the CLJS source files: `syntax.cljs`, `core.cljs`, `events.cljs` and
  `effects.cljs`.

A third party developer does not need any static resources (e.g. the
JS files generated by `cljsbuild`) to be able to use the `Enfocus`
lib, because those resources are used for testing purpouse only.

### Fill the package with the right content

We'll go on step by step.

#### Include the CLJS sources generated by `:crossovers`

To include the `syntax.cljs` file generated by the `:crossovers`
option we need to add to the `cljsbuild` section the `:crossover-jar
true` setting as well.

```clj
(defproject enfocus "2.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  :cljsbuild
  {...
   :crossover-jar true
   ...})
```

Run the `lein jar` command again and inspect the emitted jar package.

```bash
lein jar
Compiling ClojureScript.
Created /Users/mimmo/devel/enfocus/target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```bash
jar tvf target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
...
  2105 Fri Oct 11 16:46:00 CEST 2013 enfocus/enlive/syntax.cljs
```

The `syntax.cljs` source is now included in the jar package. First
problem solved.

#### Include all the CLJS sources

The `cljsbuild` plugin offers a `:jar true` option which is settable
in each `build` in the `:builds` section. This is very similar to the
just used `:crossover-jar` option.

```clj
(defproject enfocus "2.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  :cljsbuild
  {...
   :builds {:whitespace
            {:source-paths ["src/cljs" "test/cljs"]
             :jar true
             ...}}})
```

Here we added the `:jar true` setting to the `:whitespace` build only,
but we could have choosen any of the other builds as well, because
they all look at the same `:source-paths` option configuration to
compile down their JS files.

Run the `lein jar` command again and inspect the emitted jar package.

```bash
lein jar
Compiling ClojureScript.
Created /Users/mimmo/devel/enfocus/target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```bash
jar tvf target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

1330646 Fri Oct 11 15:57:14 CEST 2013 public/js/whitespace.js
  1928 Fri Oct 11 10:26:10 CEST 2013 enfocus/enlive/syntax.clj
  4386 Fri Oct 11 10:26:10 CEST 2013 enfocus/macros.clj
  2105 Fri Oct 11 17:08:26 CEST 2013 enfocus/enlive/syntax.cljs
 23336 Fri Oct 11 17:08:26 CEST 2013 enfocus/core.cljs
  4247 Fri Oct 11 17:08:26 CEST 2013 enfocus/events.cljs
  6851 Fri Oct 11 17:08:26 CEST 2013 enfocus/effects.cljs
   168 Fri Oct 11 17:08:26 CEST 2013 enfocus/core_test.cljs
```

That's better than before, but still unsatisfactory. As you see, even
if all the `cljs` sources are now included in the jar package, the JS
sources are still packaged in the `jar` and the `core_test.cljs`
fictional unit test as well.

#### Remove any generated JS sources

Let's take care of the generated JS first.

At the beginning of the [previous tutorial][1] we have shown the
*quasi standard directories layout* of a mixed CLJ/CLJS project and
talked a bit about the separation of concerns principle applied to the
static resources of a project.

In a CLJ/CLJS lib any static resource needed by a third party
developer to use the lib itself has to be parked in the `resources`
directory. Instead, any static resource needed during the
developing/testing phase of a lib has to be saved in the
`dev-resources` directory. This is because the `lein jar` command will
only include into the generated `jar` the resources registered in the
`resources` directory.

In the `Enfocus` project all the emitted JS files are used for testing
purpouse only, not for releasing the lib to third parties.

Let's then rename the `resources` directory as `dev-resources` and
modify any referece to it in the `project.clj`.

```bash
mv resources dev-resources
```

```clj
(defproject enfocus "2.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  {...
   :builds {:whitespace
            {...
             :compiler
             {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/whitespace.js"
              ...}}
             
            :simple 
            {...
			 :compiler
             {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/simple.js"
              ...}}
             
            :advanced
            {...
             :compiler
             {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/advanced.js"
              ...}}}
   :test-commands {"whitespace"
                   ["runners/phantomjs.js" "dev-resources/public/js/whitespace.js"]
                   
                   "simple"           
                   ["runners/phantomjs.js" "dev-resources/public/js/simple.js"]
                   
                   "advanced"
                   ["runners/phantomjs.js" "dev-resources/public/js/advanced.js"]}})
```

As you see, each `:output-to` and `:test-commands` setting are now
referecing the `dev-resources` directory.

Run the `lein jar` task again and inspect the emitted jar package.

```bash
lein jar
Compiling ClojureScript.
Created /Users/mimmo/devel/enfocus/target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```bash
jar tvf target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
...
  1928 Fri Oct 11 10:26:10 CEST 2013 enfocus/enlive/syntax.clj
  4386 Fri Oct 11 10:26:10 CEST 2013 enfocus/macros.clj
  2105 Fri Oct 11 19:56:20 CEST 2013 enfocus/enlive/syntax.cljs
 23336 Fri Oct 11 19:56:20 CEST 2013 enfocus/core.cljs
  4247 Fri Oct 11 19:56:20 CEST 2013 enfocus/events.cljs
  6851 Fri Oct 11 19:56:20 CEST 2013 enfocus/effects.cljs
   168 Fri Oct 11 19:56:20 CEST 2013 enfocus/core_test.cljs
```

The JS sources are not included in the `jar` anymore. Much better than
before. We now have to find a way to exclude the `core_test.cljs`
fictional unit test.

#### Remove unit tests

The `core_test.cljs` unit test is included in the `jar` package
because the `:whitespace` build that we have selected to be augumented
with the `:jar true` setting still has the `"test/cljs"` directory set
as value in the `:source-paths` option.

But wait minute, if we remove the `"test/cljs"` directory from the
`:whitespace` build, we will not be able to test it anymore. The
easier way to solve this problem is to copy the build with a new name,
remove the `:jar true` setting from the `:whitespace` build, remove
the `"test/cljs"` directory from the `:source-paths` option of the
newly copied build and finally rename the JS file to be generated.

```clj
(defproject enfocus "2.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
   :cljsbuild
  {...
   :builds {:deploy
            {:source-paths ["src/cljs"]
             :jar true
             :compiler
             {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/deploy.js"
              :optimizations :whitespace
              :pretty-print true}}
            ...
			:advanced
            {:source-paths ["src/cljs" "test/cljs"]
             :compiler
             {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/advanced.js"
              :optimizations :advanced
              :pretty-print false}}}
   ...)
```

We now have four builds. Three of them are used for testing purpouse
only and one of them, the `:deploy` one, is used by the `lein jar`
tasks to include the `Enfocus` CLJS sources in the `jar` package.

Run the `lein jar` task again and inspect the emitted jar package.

```bash
lein jar
Compiling ClojureScript.
Compiling "dev-resources/public/js/deploy.js" from ["src/cljs"]...
Successfully compiled "dev-resources/public/js/deploy.js" in 38.729721 seconds.

```

> NOTE 1: This time the `lein jar` task runs the compilation of the new
> `:deploy` build as well.

```bash
jar tvf target/enfocus-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    92 Fri Oct 11 20:16:10 CEST 2013 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

  6851 Fri Oct 11 20:16:10 CEST 2013 enfocus/effects.cljs
```

Great. We now have a jar package which includes exactly what is needed
by a third party developer to use the `Enfocus` artifact.

## Instrument Enfocus

As a next step we'd like to instrument `Enfocus` with the
[piggieback][5] lib introduced in the
[Tutorial 19 - A survival guide for livin' on the edge][7] by adding
it to the `:dev` profile. We're also going to exploit this opportunity
to move few stuff to the `:dev` profile as well.

```clj
(defproject org.clojars.magomimmo/enfocus "2.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  ;; piggieback requires a 2.2.0 minimun lein version
  :min-lein-version "2.2.0"
  ...
  ;; we moved the clojurescript.test lib into the dev profile
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-1913"]
                 [domina "1.0.2"]
                 [org.jsoup/jsoup "1.7.2"]]
  ...
    
  :cljsbuild
  {:crossovers [enfocus.enlive.syntax]
   :crossover-jar true
   ;; we moved all the builds to support unit testing into the dev profile
   :builds {:deploy
            {:source-paths ["src/cljs"]
             :jar true
             :compiler
             {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/deploy.js"
              :optimizations :whitespace
              :pretty-print true}}}}

  :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[com.cemerick/clojurescript.test "0.0.4"]
                                  [com.cemerick/piggieback "0.1.0"]]

                   :cljsbuild 
                   {:builds {:whitespace
                             {:source-paths ["src/cljs" "test/cljs"]
                              :compiler
                              {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/whitespace.js"
                               :optimizations :whitespace
                               :pretty-print true}}

                             :simple
                             {:source-paths ["src/cljs" "test/cljs"]
                              :compiler
                              {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/simple.js"
                               :optimizations :simple
                               :pretty-print false}}

                             :advanced
                             {:source-paths ["src/cljs" "test/cljs"]
                              :compiler
                              {:output-to "dev-resources/public/js/advanced.js"
                               :optimizations :advanced
                               :pretty-print false}}}

                    :test-commands {"whitespace"
                                    ["runners/phantomjs.js" "dev-resources/public/js/whitespace.js"]
                   
                                    "simple"           
                                    ["runners/phantomjs.js" "dev-resources/public/js/simple.js"]
                   
                                    "advanced"
                                    ["runners/phantomjs.js" "dev-resources/public/js/advanced.js"]}}
                               
                   :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [cemerick.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]}
                   :injections [(require '[cljs.repl.browser :as brepl]
                                         '[cemerick.piggieback :as pb])
                                (defn browser-repl []
                                  (pb/cljs-repl :repl-env
                                                (brepl/repl-env :port 9000)))]}})
```

First we augumented the project with the `:dev` profile and we also
added to it the `piggieback` instrumentation which requires the
`:repl-options` and the `:injections` setting as well.

Next we moved the `clojurescript.test` lib into the `:dependencies`
option of the `:dev` profile.

Finally we moved to the `:dev` profile the builds used for testing
purpose only and the corresponding test-commands as well.

Great. The project is still compiling and building the `jar` package
as expected. We should now predispose the `Enfocus` project, already
instrumented with `piggieback`, to connect itself to the browser JS
engine as we explained in the [Tutorial 18 - Housekeeping][8].

## Postpone the bREPL connection

As you remember there are more step to be done:

* create and run an http server to respect the
  [same origin policy][9];
* create a cljs source file to create the bREPL connection;
* create an html page which includes the link to the bREPL connection;
* launch the `lein repl` task from the main project directory;
* call the `(browser-repl)` function from the CLJ REPL;
* visit the above html page;
* use the bREPL.

We're going to pospone all this stuff to the next tutorial, because we
first want to deploy the revised `Enfocus` lib to `clojars` and try to
use it in a very simple new project to verify that even after all the
changes we did, the `Enfocus` lib is still working as expected.

## Deploy on clojars

Let's deploy the new `2.0.1-SNAPSHOT` artifact to `clojars`:

```bash
lein deploy clojars

```

Good. It worked too.

## Test with a simple project

We did a lot of working by refactoring the directories layout of
`Enfocus` and by deeply altering its project configuration, but we did
not even touch a single line of its codebase. So, we should expect
that we can still create a very simple project which depends on the
revisited `Enfocus` lib without incurring in any trouble.

### Create a new project

First create a new lein project.

```bash
lein new hello-enfocus
cd hello-enfocus
```

Then edit its `project.clj` as follows:

```clj
(defproject hello-enfocus "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :min-lein-version "2.2.0"
  :source-paths ["src/clj"]
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-1913"]
                 [org.clojars.magomimmo/enfocus "2.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]]
  :plugins [[lein-cljsbuild "0.3.3"]]

  :cljsbuild {:builds {:whitespace
                       {:source-paths ["src/cljs"]
                        :compiler 
                        {:output-to "resources/public/js/hello.js"
                         :optimizations :whitespace
                         :pretty-print true}}}})
```

Now reorganize the directories layout by following the *quasi standard
directories layout* we introduced at the beginning of the
[previous tutorial][1].

```bash
mkdir -p src/{cljs/hello_enfocus,clj}
mv src/hello_enfocus src/clj
```

Now create the `core.cljs` file in the `src/cljs/hello-enfocus`
directory with the following content:

```clj
(ns hello-enfocus.core
  (:require [enfocus.core :as ef]
            [enfocus.events :as events]
	    [enfocus.effects :as effects])
  (:require-macros [enfocus.macros :as em]))

(defn start [] 
  (ef/at js/document
    ["body"] (ef/content "Hello Enfocus!")))

(set! (.-onload js/window) start)
```

Next compile it as usual.

```bash
lein cljsbuild once
Compiling ClojureScript.
Retrieving org/clojars/magomimmo/enfocus/2.0.1-SNAPSHOT/enfocus-2.0.1-20131012.135716-2.pom from clojars

Compiling "resources/public/js/hello.js" from ["src/cljs"]...
Successfully compiled "resources/public/js/hello.js" in 10.468363 seconds.
```

Then create the `hello.html` file in the `resources/public` directory
with the following content:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello, Enfocus!</title>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- pointing to cljsbuild generated js file -->
    <script src="js/hello.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now open the `~/dev/hello-enfocus/resources/public/hello.html` file
in your browser and you should see the `Hello, Enfocus!` string
shown in the page.

Stay tuned for the next tutorial.
