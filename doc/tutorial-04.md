# Tutorial 4 - Modern ClojureScript

In this tutorial we're going to start by porting a few JavaScript (JS)
samples from the book [Modern JavaScript: Development and Design][1] by
[Larry Ullman][2]. You can download the code from the book [here][3].

The reason I choose it as a reference is because it starts smoothly, but
keeps a robust approach to JS coding. I think that bringing Larry's
approach from JS into ClojureScript (CLJS) could be helpful to anyone
not yet fluent in CLJS.

## Introduction

As everybody knows, in the 1990s JS was primarily used for
improving and validating HTML forms. Then, in the second half of the
2000s, JS started to be used to make asynchronous requests to a server
side resource and within a few months, we had two new buzzwords, Ajax
and Web 2.0.

As I said, I'm going to follow the already cited [Modern JavaScript][1]
book to try to translate [Larry Ullman's][2] approach into a kind of
Modern ClojureScript.

So let's start by migrating his first example to CLJS, a login form,
because it's very instructive both in explaining the evolution of the use
of JS in the latest decade, and in starting CLJS programming without
knowing much about Clojure and/or ClojureScript themselves.

> NOTE 1: I'm of the opinion that CLJS should be easier to set up not
> only to use, as server-side devs, but for smart client-side devs as
> well.  Application logic is moving fast from server-side to
> client-side and all of us, as server-side devs, never had much love
> for that LISP dressed in C running in the browser and named JS. We now
> have the opportunity to see the best LISP ever *running in the
> browser* and we should try to bring client-side programmers with
> us. Otherwise, we risk seeing said LISP in C's clothing *running on
> the server-side* too.

## Preamble

If you want to start working from the end of the [previous tutorial][16],
assuming you've [git][20] installed, do as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
cd modern-cljs
git checkout tutorial-03
git checkout -b tutorial-04-step-1
```

## Registration form

If you downloaded the [Modern JS][3] code samples, you'll find `login.html`,
`css/styles.css` and `js/login.js` files in the `ch02` directory.

![Modern ch02 tree][5]

If you open `login.html` with your browser you should see something like
this:

![Login Form][6]

Now, let's take a look at the HTML.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Login</title>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- login.html -->
    <form action="login.php" method="post" id="loginForm">
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Login</legend>

            <div>
              <label for="email">Email Address</label>
              <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>

            </div>

            <div>
              <label for="password">Password</label>
              <input type="password" name="password" id="password"
              required>
            </div>

            <div>
              <label for="submit"></label>
              <input type="submit" value="Login &rarr;" id="submit">
            </div>

        </fieldset>
    </form>

    <script src="js/login.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```
### Progressive enhancement and unobtrusive JS

Note that each element has both a `name` attribute and an `id`
attribute. The `name` value will be used when the form data is submitted
to the server-side. The `id` value will be used by JS/CSS.

`login.php` script is associated with the `form action`. And `login.js` is
linked within the html page. Aside from `login.js` being linked within
`login.html`, there is no direct connection between the `form` and the
JS script. This choice has to do with the so called *progressive
enhancement* and *unobtrusive JS* that Larry Ullman clearly explains in
his book.

The following [sequence diagrams][4] show this approach in action.

#### Server-side only validation

![Login Form Seq DIA 1][8]

The form submitted by the user will be validated by the server-side `php
script` named `login.php`. If the validation check passes, the server
will log in the user, `else` the server will return the errors to
the user for correction.

Thanks to JS and Ajax, this user experience can be improved a lot. A
better solution is to perform a client-side validation using JS, which
bring us to the second sequence diagram.

#### Client-side validation

![Login Form Seq DIA 2][9]

If the client-side (i.e. JS) validation passes, we still have to ask the
server-side validation for security reasons. But if the client-side
validation does not pass, we do not need to make a round-trip to the
server and we can immediately return the errors to the user.

But we still have some problems. The client-side validation cannot
check if the username is registered. This bring us to Ajax and
the third sequence diagram.

#### Ajax in action

![login Form Seq DIA 3][10]

The user experience has now been much more enhanced. The Ajax call
communicates with the server (e.g., to verify if the email address does
exist) resulting in a more efficient and responsive process.

In this tutorial, we are going to limit ourselves to the client-side
validation scenario without implementing the server-side validation
or the Ajax call to the server. We will implement those in
subsequent more advanced tutorials.

## JavaScript

That said, let's take a look at `login.js` code:

```JavaScript
// Script 2.3 - login.js

// Function called when the form is submitted.
// Function validates the form data and returns a Boolean value.
function validateForm() {
    'use strict';

    // Get references to the form elements:
    var email = document.getElementById('email');
    var password = document.getElementById('password');

    // Validate!
    if ( (email.value.length > 0) && (password.value.length > 0) ) {
        return true;
    } else {
        alert('Please complete the form!');
        return false;
    }

} // End of validateForm() function.

// Function called when the window has been loaded.
// Function needs to add an event listener to the form.
function init() {
    'use strict';

    // Confirm that document.getElementById() can be used:
    if (document && document.getElementById) {
        var loginForm = document.getElementById('loginForm');
        loginForm.onsubmit = validateForm;
    }

} // End of init() function.

// Assign an event listener to the window's load event:
window.onload = init;
```

## Porting to ClojureScript

It has been not a short trip, but we can now start to port the login
form validation from JS to CLJS. We're going to start off directly
translating JS to CLJS using [CLJS interop][12] with the underlying
JavaScript Virtual Machine (JSVM).

The JS `validateForm()` function gets `email` and `password` ids from
form input and verifies that both have a value. The `validateForm()`
function returns `true` if the validation passes, `false` otherwise.

Now let's write some CLJS code. Create the file `login.cljs` in the
`src/cljs/modern_cljs` directory and write the following code:

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.login)

;; define the function to be attached to form submission event
(defn validate-form []
  ;; get email and password element from their ids in the HTML form
  (let [email (.getElementById js/document "email")
        password (.getElementById js/document "password")]
    (if (and (> (count (.-value email)) 0)
             (> (count (.-value password)) 0))
      true
      (do (js/alert "Please, complete the form!")
          false))))

;; define the function to attach validate-form to onsubmit event of
;; the form
(defn init []
  ;; verify that js/document exists and that it has a getElementById
  ;; property
  (if (and js/document
           (.-getElementById js/document))
    ;; get loginForm by element id and set its onsubmit property to
    ;; our validate-form function
    (let [login-form (.getElementById js/document "loginForm")]
      (set! (.-onsubmit login-form) validate-form))))

;; initialize the HTML page in unobtrusive way
(set! (.-onload js/window) init)
```

As you can see, this ported code defines two functions: `validate-form`
and `init`.

> NOTE 2: note that in CLJ/CLJS the use of CamelCase to name things is not
> idiomatic. That's why we translated `validateForm` to `validate-form`.

The `let` form allows you to define a kind of local variables, like
`var` in the above JS code. As noted, we extensively used the "."
and ".-" JS interop to call JS native functions
(e.g. `.getElementById`) and to get/set JS object properties
(i.e. `.-value`) or functions we want as value (e.g. `.-getElementById`
and `.-onsubmit`), rather than execute. This is one of the
[differences between CLJS and CLJ][12] that depends on the underlying
host virtual machine (i.e. JSVM versus JVM).

Copy the `login.html` file from [ch02 of Modern JS Code][3] to
`resources/public` directory.

> NOTE 3: If you're using an HTML5 browser, instruct the form to
> deactivate input validation by adding `novalidate` as the last
> attribute of the form. Pay attention to the `novalidate` spelling,
> otherwise the HTML5 browser will be free to intercept the fields
> attribute `required` and check for them before JS is involved and you
> would not see the alert window be opened by CLJS.

Finally, set the `src` script tag attribute value to
`js/modern.js`. Here is the final `login.html`

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Login</title>
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- login.html -->
    <form action="login.php" method="post" id="loginForm" novalidate>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Login</legend>

            <div>
              <label for="email">Email Address</label>
              <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>
            </div>

            <div>
              <label for="password">Password</label>
              <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required>
            </div>

            <div>
              <label for="submit"></label>
              <input type="submit" value="Login &rarr;" id="submit">
            </div>

        </fieldset>
    </form>
    <script src="js/modern.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

We're almost done.  Copy `style.css` file from
[ch02/css][3] of Modern JS Code  to `resources/public/css` directory.

## CLJS Compilation

Now we can compile our `login.cljs` as usual (cfr. [Tutorial 1][11])

```bash
lein cljsbuild once
Could not find metadata thneed:thneed:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml in central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2)
Retrieving thneed/thneed/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml (1k)
    from https://clojars.org/repo/
Compiling ClojureScript.
Compiling "resources/public/js/modern.js" from "src/cljs"...
Successfully compiled "resources/public/js/modern.js" in 5.075248 seconds.
```
If you want to trigger automatic JS recompilation whenever you change
CLJS source code, just replace the command `once` with `auto` like so:

```bash
lein cljsbuild auto
```

## Run

Open `login.html` in your browser to verify that everything went
well.

![Login Form][13]

Note that the browser shows both the login form and the "Hello,
ClojureScript!" text from the [first tutorial][11]. The reason for that
will be explained in a subsequent tutorial on [Google Closure
Compiler][17].

Now let's play with the form:

* if you click the login button before having filled both email and
password fields you should see the alert window popping up and asking
you to complete the form;
* if you click the login button after having filled both email and
  password fields you should see the usual browser error message
  saying that the page
  `/path/to/modern-cljs/resources/public/login.php` could not be
  found. That's because the action attribute of the html form
  still references `login.php` as the server-side validation
  script. The server-side validation will be implemented in CLJ in a
  subsequent tutorial.

![Please, complete the form][14]

![File not found][15]

## The fun part

In this last paragraph of the tutorial you can start to have some fun
with the brepl and the CLJ http-server we introduced in [tutorial 3][16]

0. launch the compile task in auto mode: `lein cljsbuild auto`
1. launch the brepl from a new terminal window: `lein trampoline
   cljsbuild repl-listen`
2. launch the ring server from a new terminal window: `lein ring
   server`
3. visit the login page: `http://localhost:3000/login.html`
4. evaluate `(in-ns 'modern-cljs.login)` in the brepl
5. evaluate `validate-form` in the brepl. You should see the JS function
generated by CLJS compiler with the support of Google Closure Compiler;
6. evaluate `(validate-form)`. You should see the Alert Window asking
you to complete the form.
7. go on interacting with the browser via the brepl.

If you fill both the email and password and click the login button,
you'll see the `Not found page` we set up with compojure in
[Tutorial 3][16]

If you created a new git branch as suggested in the preamble of this
tutorial, I suggest you to commit the changes as follows

```bash
git commit -am "modern javascript"
```

# Next Step [Tutorial 5: Introducing Domina][18]

In the [next tutorial][18] we're going to use [domina library][19] to
make our login form validation more clojure-ish.
