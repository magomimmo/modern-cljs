# Tutorial 8 - Introducing Domina Events

Starting from [Tutorial 5][1], we introduced the [domina library][2] to
approach CLJS programming in a more clojure-ish way, rather than
using CLJS/JS interop features.

## Preamble

If you want to start working from the end of the [previous tutorial][5],
assuming you've [git][10] installed, do as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
cd modern-cljs
git checkout tutorial-07
git checkout -b tutorial-08-step-1
```

## Introduction

We touched `domina` superficially by using `by-id` to select individual
elements from the DOM, and `value` and `set-value!` to get/set the value of a
form field.

It's now time to see what the domina library has to offer for substituting
CLJS/JS interop features in managing events.

## Listen to events

Let's go back to the [shopping calculator form][3] we introduced in
Tutorial 5.

First of all, by having been cloned from the orginal HTML code of
[Modern JavaScript: Develop and Design][4], the shopping form used a
`submit` type of button. At the moment, the shopping calculator data
are not sent to a server-side script to be validated. Until we'll
[introduce a server-side script for that][11], we are going to use a
`button` type and remove both `action` and `method` attributes from
the corresponding `form` tag.

> NOTE 1: We know that, by substituting `submit` with `button` type,
> we're breaking the progressive enhancement strategy, but we're now
> interested in grasping step by step the [domina events][2]
> machinery. We'll fix it [later][11].

Here is the updated html code.

  </form>
  <script src="js/modern_dbg.js"></script>
  <script>
    modern_cljs.shopping.init();

```

> NOTE 2: In [Tutorial 7][5] we set the `:cljsbuild` configuration options
> to generate three different builds: `:dev`, `:pre-prod` and `:prod`
> which emitted three differents JS (`modern_dbg.js`,
> `modern_pre.js` and `modern.js`). Then we replicated three html file
> (i.e. `shopping-dbg.html`, `shopping-pre.html` and `shopping.html`)
> to include the appropriate JS file emitted by the three different

Here is the updated shopping calculator form as rendered by the browser.

![Shopping calculator][6]

### Domina events

As you perhaps remember, to manage the shopping calculator we defined
the `calculate` function and the `init` function to attach `calculate`
to the `submit` button of the `shoppingForm`.

`domina.events` namespace offers a bunch of functions to manage DOM
events. One of them is the `listen!` function, wich allows us to
attach an handling function (e.g. `calculate`) to a DOM event type
(e.g. `click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, etc).

Let's now update `shopping.cljs` by requiring the `domina.events`
namespace and by substituting the `.-onsubmit` JS interop with the
`listen!` function as follows:

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.shopping
  (:require [domina :as dom]
            [domina.events :as ev]))

(defn calculate []
  (let [quantity (dom/value (dom/by-id "quantity"))
        price (dom/value (dom/by-id "price"))
        tax (dom/value (dom/by-id "tax"))
        discount (dom/value (dom/by-id "discount"))]
    (dom/set-value! (dom/by-id "total") (-> (* quantity price)
                                    (* (+ 1 (/ tax 100)))
                                    (- discount)
                                    (.toFixed 2)))))

(defn ^:export init []
  (if (and js/document
           (.-getElementById js/document))
    (ev/listen! (dom/by-id "calc") :click calculate)))
```

> NOTE 3: We now `:require` `domina` instead of just `:use` it as in
> [previous tutorials][7]. Note that we also deleted the returned
> `false` value from `calculate` definition because, when using
> `button` input type instead of `submit` input type, we do not need to
> return the control to the form itself.

> NOTE 4: As usual, the `init` function has been exported to protect its
> name from been changed by Google Closure Compiler aggressive compilation
> used in `:prod` build (i.e. `:advanced`).

You can now compile and run the project as usual:

```bash
lein ring server # from modern-cljs home
lein cljsbuild auto dev # from modern-cljs home in a new terminal
```

If you want interact with the bREPL, just execute the usual command to
run the bREPL.

```bash
lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen # from modern-cljs home in a new terminal
```

Verify that everything is still working as expected by visiting
[`shopping-dbg.html][8] page.

### Bubbling and capture models

Domina library supports both *bubbling* and *capture* event models. In
the above shopping calculator example we used the domina `listen!`
function for handling the mouse `click` event on the *Calculate*
button. `listen!` is a member of a group of functions defined by domina
to use the *bubbling* method of handling DOM events. If you want to
experience the *capture* method you have just to substitute in the
`init` definition the `listen!` call with the corresponding `capture!`
call and you're done.

```clojure
;;; the rest as before

(defn ^:export init []
  (if (and js/document
           (.-getElementById js/document))
    (ev/capture! (dom/by-id "calc") :click calculate)))
```

If you created a new git branch as suggested in the preamble of this
tutorial, I suggest you to commit the changes as follows

```bash
git commit -am "introducing domina events"
```

# Next Step - [Tutorial 9: DOM Manipulation][9]

In the next tutorial we'are going to face the need to programmatically
manipulate DOM elements as a result of the occurrance of some DOM
events (e.g., `mouseover`, `mouseout`, etc.).
